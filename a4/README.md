# LIS4381 - Mobile Web Application Development

## Tanner Morlan

### **Assignment 4 Requirements:**

*Five Parts*

1. Use regexp to only allow appropriate characters for each control
2. Show failed validation
3. Show passed validation
4. Redesign pages by including new images, new colors, and formatting.
5. Research what the following validation code does:
```
valid: 'fa fa-check' - When the form is valid, there will be a check mark displayed from the font awesome library.
invalid: 'fa fa-times' - When the form is invalid, there will be an "X" icon displayed from the font awesome library.
validating: 'fa fa-refresh' - When the form is validating, a refresh icon will display from the font awesome library.
```

**README.md file should include the following items:**

- Screenshot of LIS4381 Portal (Main Page)
